This project aims to predict the energy consumption of household appliances** using machine learning regression techniques.  
It leverages environmental, temporal, and indoor sensor data from a smart home to forecast how much energy will be used at a given time.
Energy efficiency has become an essential part of modern smart home systems.  
This project builds a predictive model that estimates appliance energy usage (Wh) based on multiple environmental and sensor inputs such as temperature, humidity, lights, and time of day.

It uses regression-based models (Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to predict the target variable — Appliances, which represents energy consumption in watt-hours.
